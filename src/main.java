// Project 3: Scaling behavior of sorting algorithms 
// Due Mon May 20
//
// Implement Selection, Heap, Merge and QuickSort. Test them on random arrays of increasing orders of magnitude to examine 
// their scaling behavior. Graph your results. Extrapolate your results and experimentally verify the accuracy of your estimates. 
// Here are the details:
//
// 1. Construct a class for each sort method using the algorithms on the course web site. Test your code to verify that all the 
// sort methods work properly. Construct a main driver class that uses a switch statement and inheritance to run different sort methods.
//
// 2. Instrument each algorithm to count comparisons, moves and elapsed time by constructing a SortTimer class as discussed in class. 
// Use System.nanoTime() and divide by 1,000 to get the clock time in microseconds.
//
// 3. Run your code on random arrays of size n = 10^i, i = 1. . .4. Run five instances of each sample size and take the average 
// of each measure.
//
// 4. Plot the elapsed time and comparison count against n using a decimal logarithmic scale on each axis.
//
// 5. Use the information obtained to estimate the time and count for n = 10^5 and 10^6.
//
// 6. Now run Selection sort for n = 5 and the other three methods for n = 6 and calculate 
// the relative error of your estimates. Report your results in a table.
//
// 7. Submit a project report that includes all tables, graphs, code and output.

public class main {
	// Construct a main driver class that uses a switch statement and
	// inheritance to run different sort methods.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
